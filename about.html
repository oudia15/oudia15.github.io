        <div class="">
          <p>Hello, my name is Oumar Diarra, a recent Southeastern Louisiana University
              graduate with a master’s in Integrated Science and Technology with concentration in
              Computer Science. In love with the process of developing software, my most valuable asset
              is my constant eagerness to learn and grow my skill set. My academic training coupled with
              the experiences I have acquired from the various projects I’ve worked on, allowed me to
              obtain certain skills that I believe will serve me in any software development position. During my studies in the
              ISAT program, I also developed a deep appreciation for research. I am a strong believer of
              hard work and constant learning, and I believe these character qualities are
              valuable assets .</p>

              <p>Throughout the matriculation of my curriculum, I worked on multiple software
                development projects. Some of those projects include: Windows-based automation
                applications, web applications using the “.NET” framework, and software used to aid in the
                management of vehicle maintenance. I also gained experience performing tasks such as:
                Frontend development with Emberjs, backend development with java 8, unit testing,
                automated browser testing.</p>

                <p>I believe the world of software development requires you to balance the standard of
                    knowledge gathered from academic training along with an individual’s unique skill set
                    derived from specific experiences in order to pursue and briefly capture the ever fleeting
                    innovation. </p>

                    <p>Thank you for your time and attention. I hope you learned a little bit about me. </p>
                      <p>
                        Sincerely, <br>
                        Oumar Diarra
                      </p>
        </div>
